#### Python, TensorFlow, Keras  

- Developed Python to predict the nature of mammogram masses and employed Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and a neural network using Keras. 
- Assessed the performance of each algorithm by comparing important metrics, including precision, recall, and  F1-score.
